The program creates a AVL Tree.

It has the following features:
	- Input keys from a data file into the AVL Tree
	- Input keys to the AVL Tree manually
	- Search for keys in the AVL Tree wih knowing their frequency
	- Remove a key from the AVL Tree
	- Find the Height and Size of the AVL Tree
	- Find keys which its frequency is equal to or more than a given frequency.

To compile the program you need to type 'make' without the quotations.
To run the program you need to type './avltree' without the quotations.

Sample Output:

	$ ./avltree
